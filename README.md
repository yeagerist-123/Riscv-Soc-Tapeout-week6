<img width="1522" height="843" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83592182-224f-4125-bd9b-eaf4336b4a29" />



In RTL2GDS physical design, there are various terms encountered. A few key terms are:

<img width="948" height="790" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e0bf192-c750-4919-b98c-d53b1f5c5118" />


### **Package**
- The **package** is the casing that houses the semiconductor device.  
- It protects the chip from physical damage and provides electrical connections to the circuit board.  
- **Example:** QFN-48 (Quad Flat No-Leads) — a package with **48 pins**.

### **Chip**
- The **chip** sits inside the package and connects to the package pins through **wire bonding**.  
- It contains various internal parts like the **pad**, **core**, and **interconnects**.


<img width="1288" height="795" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df9fc75a-d702-4cf0-9cb0-de700b19c324" />

- Inside  of the CHIP
  
### **Pads**
- Pads connect the internal signals from the chip’s core to the external pins.  
- They are arranged in a **Pad Frame** around the edges of the chip.  
- Pads can be of several types:
  - **Input Pads**
  - **Output Pads**
  - **Power Pads**
  - **Ground Pads**

### **Die**
- The **die** is the physical silicon piece that contains all the chip’s functional circuits.  
- It represents the total area of the chip.
  
### **Core**
- The **core** is the main area of the chip where computation happens.  
- It includes all the **logic circuits** (like gates, multiplexers, etc.) used to perform operations and produce outputs.


<img width="1195" height="804" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42c1621f-4891-47b7-bdb5-089a10651b8f" />

The **core** can contain two main types of blocks:

### **Analog Blocks**
- These are **foundry-provided IPs (Intellectual Properties)**.  
- Common examples include:
  - **ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)**
  - **DAC (Digital to Analog Converter)**
  - **PLL (Phase-Locked Loop)**
  - **SRAM (Static Random Access Memory)**

### **Digital Blocks**
- These are **macro blocks** that perform digital logic functions.  
- Common examples include:
  - **RISC-V SoC (System on Chip)**
  - **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)**


### Introduction to RISC-V

# RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computing)

**RISC-V** is an **open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** used to design computer processors.  
It focuses on simplicity, efficiency, and flexibility — making it a popular choice for modern hardware design.

<img width="1785" height="1105" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97b6600f-e4e0-4048-8617-4e7ceadc085a" />


## What is RISC-V?

- **RISC-V** stands for **Reduced Instruction Set Computing – Version 5**.  
- It defines the **set of instructions** that a processor can understand and execute.  
- Unlike proprietary ISAs (like x86 or ARM), RISC-V is **open-source**, meaning anyone can use and modify it freely.

##  Key Features

- **Simple and Clean Design:**  
  RISC-V has a small, efficient set of instructions, making processors easier to design and optimize.

- **High Performance:**  
  The reduced instruction set allows for faster execution and easier hardware implementation.

- **Flexible and Extensible:**  
  Developers can add **custom extensions** to tailor the architecture for specific applications.

- **Open-Source and Collaborative:**  
  Being open means researchers, companies, and developers can collaborate easily and innovate faster.

## Why It’s Popular

- Encourages **innovation** without licensing fees.  
- Supports **custom hardware designs** for AI, IoT, embedded systems, and high-performance computing.  
- Adopted by many **companies and research institutions** around the world.  

# Software Applications to Hardware

When you run a program on a computer, it doesn’t directly execute the high-level code (like C or Python).  
Instead, it goes through several steps before becoming **machine-executable hardware instructions**.

![IMG-8769](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64173714/215443267-3402518b-6809-4ca5-a753-1d2737d006da.jpg)


## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. High-Level Language
- You start by writing a program in a **high-level language** such as **C**, **C++**, or **Python**.
- This code is easy for humans to read and understand, but **hardware cannot execute it directly**.

### 2. Compilation (Compiler)
- The **compiler** translates the high-level code into **assembly language**.  
- Assembly language is **hardware-specific** — it represents instructions that the processor understands, but still in a readable format for humans.

### 3. Assembly to Machine Code (Assembler)
- The **assembler** converts the assembly language into **machine language**.  
- Machine language is made up of **binary code (0s and 1s)**, which can be directly executed by the processor.

### 4. System Software Role
The **system software** manages how the program interacts with the hardware.  
It includes:

| Component | Function |
|------------|-----------|
| **Operating System (OS)** | Handles low-level operations such as memory management, input/output, and process control |
| **Compiler** | Converts high-level source code into assembly language |
| **Assembler** | Translates assembly language into binary machine code |

### 5.Execution on Hardware
- Once in **binary form**, the code can be executed directly by the **chip**.  
- The **chip layout** defines the hardware components (like logic gates, registers, and connections) that perform the operations.

### 6. RTL (Register Transfer Level)
- The **interface between machine language and hardware** is defined through **RTL code**.  
- RTL describes the **digital logic behavior** — how data moves between registers and how computations are performed.  
- RTL is a key step in **hardware design**, bridging the gap between **software** and **physical circuits**.


> Programs move from **high-level code → assembly → binary → hardware →**,  
> with the help of the **OS, compiler, assembler,** and **RTL** that connect software instruction


## SoC design and OpenLANE

<img width="593" alt="3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64173714/215445891-5f004c86-c8c8-4ba8-bdce-976a7e8f7f68.png">

To design a **digital ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit)** using **open-source** resources, three main open-source components are required:

## 1. RTL Designs

- **RTL (Register Transfer Level)** designs describe the digital logic behavior of a circuit.  
- These designs are typically written in **Verilog** or **VHDL** and define how data moves and is processed in hardware.  
- You can find many **open-source RTL designs** on:
  - [GitHub](https://github.com)  
  - [LibreCores](https://www.librecores.org)  
  - [OpenCores](https://www.opencores.org)

## 2. PDK (Process Design Kit)

- The **PDK** is a **collection of files** that model a **semiconductor fabrication process**.  
- It acts as a **bridge between the designer and the fabrication (fab)** by providing the necessary rules and models for ASIC design.

###  PDK Includes:

1. **Process Design Rules**  
   - Defines how the chip should be physically built.  
   - Includes:
     - **DRC (Design Rule Check)** – ensures layout follows manufacturing rules.  
     - **LVS (Layout vs. Schematic)** – checks that layout matches circuit design.  
     - **PEX (Parasitic Extraction)** – analyzes real-world physical effects.

2. **Device Models**  
   - Provide electrical characteristics of transistors and components used in simulation.

3. **Digital Standard Cell Libraries**  
   - Contain pre-designed logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) used to build digital circuits.

4. **I/O Libraries**  
   - Define input/output pad cells used for chip-to-board communication.

### Example: SkyWater PDK
- Provided by **Google** and **SkyWater Technology**.  
- Known as the **SkyWater 130nm Open-Source PDK**.  
- This PDK enables open-source ASIC design and fabrication using **130nm technology**.

## 3. EDA Tools (Electronic Design Automation)

- **EDA tools** are used to design, verify, and layout the ASIC.  
- These tools automate steps such as synthesis, placement, routing, and verification.

### Popular Open-Source EDA Tools:
- **OpenROAD** – Automated digital layout flow  
- **OpenLANE** – Complete ASIC design flow based on SkyWater PDK  
-  **QFlow** – Open-source digital synthesis and layout suite  


## Simplified RTL to GDSII Flow

![IMG-8761](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64173714/215446489-bdfd9f74-92c4-40db-bb70-744d06a18289.jpg)

## 1. Synthesis

**Synthesis** converts the RTL (Register Transfer Level) code into a **gate-level netlist** using components from a standard cell library.

<img width="560" height="188" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d9115e3-d104-4781-b759-e4f6ff5ad6f2" />

- Standard cells have a **regular layout** with **fixed height** and **variable width**.  
- Each standard cell has multiple **views/models**:
  - Electrical view  
  - HDL (Hardware Description Language) view  
  - SPICE view  
  - Layout views (Abstract and Detailed)

## 2. Floor Planning & Power Planning

### Floor Planning
This step allocates silicon area and defines how different components are arranged on the chip.

- **Chip Floorplanning**:  
  Divides the chip die into regions for different system blocks and places I/O pads.
  <img width="543" height="138" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9c5b94b-6438-4483-938a-324bcd35b517" />
  
- **Macro Floorplanning**:  
  Defines block dimensions, pin locations, and placement rows.
  <img width="546" height="152" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c425a331-4cc9-4a8d-bad6-30afd19a8aa0" />

### Power Planning
Designs a **robust power distribution network** using:
- **Power rings, meshes, or stripes**  
- **Standard cell power rails**  
- **Thicker top metal layers** to minimize resistance and IR drop issues

<img width="820" height="320" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01f1e082-68e0-46f7-8e66-4974e00d93ed" />


## 3. Placement

**Placement** is the process of positioning standard cells on predefined rows within the floorplan.

<img width="466" height="157" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd35ba70-e94a-44a6-b8fb-5cd17ed5f908" />


### Steps:
1. **Global Placement** – Finds approximate (but possibly illegal) cell locations for optimal performance.  
2. **Detailed Placement** – Adjusts cells into legal positions while maintaining good performance.

<img width="532" height="176" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27641333-56d5-43d4-8eca-fb74ce8b3639" />

## 4. Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)

**Clock Tree Synthesis** distributes the clock signal to all flip-flops with **minimum skew**.

- Common structures: **H-tree** or **X-tree**
- Goal: Ensure consistent clock arrival times across the chip
<img width="177" height="130" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b2390c2-5934-4fcc-b1ff-6fce4a56d59f" />

  
## 5. Routing

**Routing** connects the placed cells using metal layers defined in the process design kit (PDK).

### Routing Details:
- **Signal Routing**: Uses multiple metal layers (horizontal and vertical) to connect signals.  
- **Routing Grid**: A large grid defines metal tracks and via positions.  

### Routing Steps:
1. **Global Routing** – Generates routing guides for major signal paths.  
2. **Detailed Routing** – Implements exact wiring using those guides.

  <img width="1158" height="403" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a6f659a-112d-41be-a162-ee10a65e91c8" />

> Example: The **Sky130** PDK defines **6 routing layers** for both global and detailed routing.

## 6. Sign-Off

The **Sign-Off** stage verifies that the final layout meets all design and manufacturing rules.

### Physical Verification
- **DRC (Design Rule Checking)** – Ensures layout complies with fabrication rules.  
- **LVS (Layout vs Schematic)** – Confirms the layout matches the circuit schematic.

### Timing Verification
- Confirms that all **timing constraints** (setup, hold, and clock requirements) are satisfied.



### About Openlane flow

**OpenLANE** is an open-source, end-to-end flow for designing digital integrated circuits — taking designs from **RTL to GDSII**.  
It integrates multiple open-source tools and is optimized for the **SkyWater 130nm Open PDK (SKY130)**.


OpenLANE enables users to design and tape out digital chips using only **open-source tools** and **open-source process design kits (PDKs)**.  
It powers the **striVe family** of fully open SoCs (System-on-Chips), which follow the principles of:
-  **Open PDK**
-  **Open EDA**
-  **Open RTL**

<img width="526" height="387" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20560799-2f3b-4784-bc90-65e83692c941" />

## Modes of Operation

OpenLANE supports two primary modes:

1. **Autonomous Mode** – Runs the complete RTL-to-GDSII flow automatically.  
2. **Interactive Mode** – Allows users to manually control and customize each stage for exploration and debugging.

##  Design Flow Stages

![IMG-8762](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64173714/215446664-5d9da8cd-d538-4c7e-9585-98f393586e6d.jpg)  


### 1. RTL Synthesis
- The **Yosys** tool processes the RTL code and converts it into a **gate-level logic circuit**.
- **ABC** performs logic optimization and maps the design to a **standard cell library**.
- Various **ABC scripts** implement different synthesis strategies for improved timing or area efficiency.

| RC Extraction | SPEF Extraction + OpenSTA |


## Step 1. Setting Up the Working Directory

Navigate to your OpenLANE working directory:

```bash
cd work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/
```
Step 2: Start the Docker Container
Run the OpenLANE Docker environment:
```
docker
```
Step 3: Launch OpenLANE in Interactive Mode
```
./flow.tcl -interactive
package require openlane 0.9
```
- Al the design files are in `openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a`
  
<img width="1920" height="923" alt="w-6-1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eccf0c1a-4923-43b6-8a3f-e7bbd421e0ce" />


Step 4: Prepare the Design
```
prep -design picorv32a 
```
> This merges configuration files and prepares the design for synthesis. Check if a merged file was created successfully.

<img width="1920" height="923" alt="w-6-2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea878668-226f-4b90-aa4a-3eb39fe4cc95" />


Step 5: Review the `runs` Directory

After each **OpenLANE** run, a new folder is created inside the `runs/` directory.  
Each run contains key files that record the **progress and results** of the design flow.

### Inside `runs/<run_name>/` you’ll find:

- **reports/** – Detailed metrics from each step (synthesis, placement, routing, STA).  
- **results/** – Final outputs such as **GDSII**, **DEF**, and **netlists**.  
- **logs/** – Terminal logs for **debugging** and **tracking** the flow execution.

> **Tip:** Reviewing these directories helps verify that each stage completed successfully and that your design meets timing and physical constraints.

```
reports/synthesis/
```
This includes:
 - Total cell count
 - Number of flip-flops
 - Logic breakdown
 - Timing results

<img width="1852" height="195" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1d0a5e8-3ffe-4308-ac4a-b019d8e1019f" />

Step 8: Calculate the Flop Ratio

Flop Ratio Formula:
```mathematica
Flop Ratio = (Number of D Flip-Flops) / (Total Number of Cells)


Flop Ratio = 1613 / 14876 = 0.108 ≈ 10.84 %
```
> Tip: A typical digital design has a flop ratio between 5% and 15%, depending on its complexity and architecture.

<img width="1848" height="961" alt="1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f25d5602-584b-4438-8c3c-fbe2773082fd" />

# 2 - Understand importance of good floorplan vs bad floorplan and introduction to library cells

## 1. Define Width and Height of Core and Die

The **core and die** dimensions are determined based on the **netlist**, which defines the connectivity between all components in the circuit.

   <img width="1363" height="971" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffd1f5ba-2b2a-4bb9-8289-b763d4d4818a" />

For example: 

<img width="566" height="192" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da1dcd5a-1934-42f6-83ef-9dee4d0fbd7b" />

- The **dimensions** depend on the number of **logic gates** and **flip-flops**, each having a specific length and width.  


  <img width="1393" height="893" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e363305d-b7b3-4382-9948-57331c64c854" />

- Example:  
  If the minimum area is **2 × 2 = 4 units**, then the chip occupies **4 units** with **100% area utilization**.
  
<img width="1285" height="578" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af6244bc-eda7-46ad-91d2-6d55ef9b04f1" />

### Utilization Factor

> **Utilization Factor** = (Area Occupied by Netlist) / (Total Area of the Core)

for example
 Utilization = (4 × 1) / (2 × 2)
 Utilization = 1 → No space left

> In practice, designs typically target **0.6 to 0.7 utilization**  
to allow space for routing and optimization.

### Aspect Ratio

> **Aspect Ratio (AR)** = Height / Width

| Aspect Ratio | Shape Description |
|---------------|------------------|
| AR = 1 | Square Shape |
| AR > 1 | Horizontal Rectangular Shape |
| AR < 1 | Vertical Rectangular Shape |


For example:

<img width="1732" height="986" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0c59db6-a142-4af4-b8c5-c28a0e348f6c" />

```mathematica
  Utilization Factor = (Area Occupied by Netlist) / (Total Area of the Core)
                     = (2 x 2) / (4 x 4)
                     = 4 / 16
                     = 0.25
- 75% is left for place the aditional cells, routing

  Aspect Ratio (AR) = Height / Width
                    = 4 / 4
                    = 1 (Square Shape)
```

## 2. Define the Locations of Pre-Placed Cells

**Pre-placed cells** are blocks or modules whose functionality is implemented **only once** and reused across the design.

### Characteristics of Pre-Placed Cells
- These cells are **fixed in position** before automated placement and routing.    
- They may have **extended I/O pins** to connect with other parts of the chip.
  <img width="1602" height="997" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bca3efdc-1295-4711-8c42-e7efc3362e9e" />
- Often include **IP blocks** (Intellectual Property cores) or **reusable modules**.
     <img width="583" height="191" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/182b90bd-ecff-4248-b0d0-a89c0699576e" />
- The **arrangement of IPs** within the chip is referred to as **floorplanning**.

### Pre-placement Process
- IP blocks and other reusable cells have **user-defined locations** on the chip.  
- These blocks are positioned **manually or semi-manually** before the automatic placement process.  
- Once pre-placed cells are fixed, the **automated placement and routing tools** arrange the **remaining standard cells** and **logic elements** around them.

## 3. Surround Pre-Placed Cells with Decoupling Capacitors

###  Placement of Pre-Placed Cells
The **location of pre-placed cells** depends on the **design scenario** and functional requirements.  
They are strategically positioned to optimize **connectivity, performance, and power distribution**.

<img width="1499" height="963" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67058ea8-7de7-4f87-a38b-f9dea17efd5e" />

### What Are Decoupling Capacitors?

**Decoupling Capacitors (Decaps)** are special capacitors placed **around pre-placed cells** to stabilize the power supply during switching events.

<img width="1415" height="861" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93daad1d-a725-4faa-97b4-936d1835ba26" />

### Function of Decoupling Capacitors

In practical circuits, wires exhibit **resistance (R)**, **inductance (L)**, and **capacitance (C)**.  
When a circuit switches states (from `0 → 1` or `1 → 0`), **voltage drops** can occur due to these parasitic effects.

Decoupling capacitors help mitigate these effects by acting as **local charge reservoirs**.


### Working Principle

- A **decoupling capacitor** is a large capacitor pre-charged with electrical energy.  
- During a switching event, it **supplies the required charge** to nearby logic cells, preventing sudden voltage drops.  
- After switching, the capacitor **recharges** from the main power supply.  
- This cycle ensures a **stable voltage level** and reduces **crosstalk** and **power noise** in the design.

<img width="1290" height="970" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7bf7a18-f8e3-49e8-a627-3bf82a8d3670" />

## 4. Power Planning

### Purpose of Power Planning

**Power Planning** ensures that every part of the chip receives a stable and sufficient power supply (VDD and VSS).  
It involves designing a power distribution network that connects all major blocks (macros) and standard cells efficiently.

### Example Scenario

Consider a design with **4 macros**.  

<img width="967" height="807" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f6db2ac-427a-444b-a0d8-021a192a599f" />

Each macro must:
- Receive consistent power from **VDD** (power) and **VSS** (ground).  
- Maintain equal signal strength between the **driver** and the **load** across the chip.

<img width="1308" height="995" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86153d94-4251-4610-9941-a942a4f25a2f" />

### Power Integrity Issues

Assume a **16-bit bus** connected to an inverter:

<img width="1448" height="880" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d595416f-53c1-4e1f-b9e1-20e3536ceba6" />

- When logic `1` (VDD) becomes logic `0`, and vice versa,  
  the switching current passes through a **single VDD tap point**.
- This creates a momentary voltage imbalance, leading to:
  1. **Ground Bounce** – Increase in ground voltage at the VSS node.

<img width="1474" height="886" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b567e75-ef9a-484a-945f-7e50d5c116ed" />

 2. **Voltage Droop** – Drop in supply voltage at the VDD node.
    
<img width="1435" height="333" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4fed4b1-dd9d-4a19-98e7-b7f319fbb2df" />

These effects can cause **timing violations**, **logic instability**, and **signal noise**.


### Solution: Multiple Power Supply Connections

To minimize these effects:
- Use **multiple power and ground connections** distributed across the chip.  
- This reduces the current drawn from any single point, minimizing **voltage droop** and **ground bounce**.  
- Ensures a **uniform power distribution network (PDN)** throughout the design.

<img width="1899" height="986" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b90616a9-f9ed-4e64-a97b-b8b90b7a0f3a" />
 
> Connecting all macros to multiple **VDD** and **VSS** taps improves power integrity, reduces noise, and ensures reliable chip operation during switching events.

## 5. Pin Placement

**pin placement**, where **input** and **output** ports are positioned around the chip core.  
Proper pin placement ensures efficient routing and balanced signal flow across the design.

###  Key Points

- **Input/Output Ports:**  
  Define where signals enter (inputs) and exit (outputs) the chip.

- **Ordering of Ports:**  
  The placement order depends on the **connectivity** between cells to minimize wire length and congestion.

- **Clock Pins:**  
  Clock ports are designed to be **larger in size** to reduce **resistance** and ensure low **clock skew** across the circuit.

<img width="1808" height="972" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f1be7ba-8568-4472-a456-94671faac67e" />

> **Good pin placement** improves timing, reduces routing complexity, and helps achieve better power and signal integrity.

## 6. Logical Cell Placement Blockage

### What Is a Placement Blockage?

A **placement blockage** is a **reserved area** on the chip where **no standard cells** can be placed.  
These regions are intentionally left empty to ensure proper spacing, routing, and signal isolation.

### Purpose of Placement Blockages

- Prevents cells from being placed **too close** to critical regions (e.g., pre-placed macros, power grids, or clock trees).  
- Ensures sufficient **routing space** and avoids **congestion**.  
- Used around **memory blocks, I/O pads**, and **analog IPs** where dense logic placement is undesirable.

<img width="1322" height="913" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2108d874-2b5a-4393-8a8f-c13ebac6c6a2" />

### Types of Blockages

- **Hard Blockage:** No cells or routing allowed.  
- **Soft Blockage:** Placement restricted, but routing may pass through.

> Logical cell placement blockages help maintain routing quality and design reliability by controlling where standard cells can be placed.


## Floorplanning in OpenLANE

###  Default Configuration Files

The **default settings** of OpenLANE are stored in:

`/home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/configuration`

<img width="1850" height="115" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5b1cf70-8011-403d-aec5-4b54593679a7" />


These files define the base parameters used during the flow unless overridden by user-specific configurations.

### User-Defined Configuration (`config.tcl`)

Each design has its own configuration file that defines project-specific parameters.  
For the **picorv32a** design, the configuration file is located at:


The user define config.tcl File
`/home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a`

Below is an example of a typical **`config.tcl`** setup:

```tcl
# Design
set ::env(DESIGN_NAME) "picorv32a"

set ::env(VERILOG_FILES) "./designs/picorv32a/src/picorv32a.v"
set ::env(SDC_FILE) "./designs/picorv32a/src/picorv32a.sdc"

# Clock Configuration
set ::env(CLOCK_PERIOD) "10.000"
set ::env(CLOCK_PORT) "clk"
set ::env(CLOCK_NET) $::env(CLOCK_PORT)

# Floorplan Settings
set ::env(FP_CORE_UTIL) 65
set ::env(FP_IO_VMETAL) 4
set ::env(FP_IO_HMETAL) 3


set filename $::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/$::env(DESIGN_NAME)/$::env(PDK)_$::env(STD_CELL_LIBRARY)_config.tcl
if { [file exists $filename] == 1} {
	source $filename
}

```
To start the floorplanning process in OpenLANE, run the following command in interactive mode:
```
run_floorplan
```
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="w6-fp1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38773d6a-8ce7-454a-93a0-54688e74b023" />

The generated DEF (Design Exchange Format) file can be found in:
```
/home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/31-10_09-36/results/floorplan
```

<img width="1920" height="923" alt="w-6-fp3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f97f94bd-14af-4899-b149-f61e50ec1bbb" />


Required Files for Viewing in Magic
To visualize the floorplan using the Magic layout tool, you’ll need the following three files:
- Magic Tech File: sky130A.tech
- LEF File: merged.lef
- DEF File: picorv32a.floorplan.def

Command to Open in Magic

Run the following command in your terminal to load the floorplan:
```bash
magic -T <location_of_techfile> \
      lef read <location_of_lef_file> \
      def read <location_of_floorplan_def_file>

cd /work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/31-10_09-36/results/floorplan

magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef  def read picorv32a.floorplan.def &
```
Once the floorplan is loaded in **Magic**, you can interact with and inspect different parts of the design using the following controls:

<img width="1920" height="923" alt="mlayout" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/525a2693-ed16-4f8d-87ba-923f43946a97" />

###  Basic Controls

## Placement

### 1. Binding Netlist with Physical Cells

After floorplanning, the next step is **placement**, where the logical netlist is **mapped to physical cells** from the standard cell library.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th align="center">Before Placement</th>
    <th align="center">After Placement</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img width="1205" height="1000" alt="Before Placement" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/692157b6-a4c4-4aae-bf01-7c2182940e85" />
    </td>
    <td align="center">

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

In the real world, **logic gates** (like AND, OR, NAND, etc.) have **physical shapes** — typically rectangular — with defined **width** and **height**.  
These cells are stored in a **standard cell library**, which contains:

-  **Shape and Size Information** – Defines the physical dimensions of each gate.  
-  **Timing (Delay) Information** – Describes how fast the cell operates.  
-  **Power Information** – Indicates power consumption characteristics.  
-  **Area Information** – Defines how much silicon space the cell occupies.  
-  **Operating Conditions** – Specifies voltage, temperature, and process parameters for accurate modeling.

<img width="1825" height="456" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cbffb00-e862-44e7-8f3f-8a32ab4727fb" />

###  2. Cell Placement

During **placement**, the tool takes all physical cells from the library and places them into the **floorplan region** according to connectivity and timing requirements.

<img width="1894" height="744" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47b36a1b-a951-46a7-a669-5d67d6599a7a" />

- The placement step determines **exact locations** of standard cells inside the chip core.  
- **Pre-placed IPs (macros)** are already fixed in the floorplan, so **no standard cells** should be placed near or overlap them.  

  <img width="1898" height="914" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5ccb39f-4df1-4c48-8bac-c1fa033b9248" />

## 3. Optimize Placement

The **placement optimization** stage focuses on improving timing, reducing wire length, and minimizing congestion while ensuring signal integrity.

- **Wire Length Estimation:**  
  The placement tool estimates wire lengths between connected cells to minimize routing complexity and delay.

- **Resistance and Capacitance:**  
  Longer wires introduce higher **resistance (R)** and **capacitance (C)**, which can degrade signal quality.  
  The relationship is given by:  R = ρ × (L / A)

where:  
- `ρ` = Resistivity of the material  
- `L` = Wire length  
- `A` = Cross-sectional area  

- **Signal Integrity and Repeaters:**  
To maintain strong signal levels over long interconnects, **repeaters** (buffers) are inserted.  
These buffers regenerate the original signal to avoid degradation, but they **consume additional area** on the chip.

- **Slew (Transition Time):**  
Slew depends on the **load capacitance**. Larger capacitance causes slower transitions, which can affect timing.

### Optimization Goals

Placement optimization ensures:
- **Optimal wire length**  
- **Minimal routing congestion**  
- **Improved timing performance**  
- **Better signal integrity**  

### Timing Analysis

After optimization:
- **Data paths** are checked to confirm timing closure.  
- The **clock is considered ideal** (zero skew condition) during early placement timing analysis.  
- **Setup timing** is verified to ensure all signals meet required arrival times **based on the design specifications** and to confirm that the **placement is correct**.

<img width="1895" height="925" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57bb14e5-f011-4c83-a0a9-8b69aa612f8c" />

> Placement optimization refines cell locations to balance **area, timing, and signal quality**, preparing the design for clock tree synthesis and routing.

**Library characterization and modeling** form the foundation for all stages of the ASIC design flow.  
Every gate or cell in the library is modeled for its **timing**, **power**, and **area** under specific process, voltage, and temperature conditions.


### Design Flow Stages Using the Same Cells

1. **Logic Synthesis** – Converts RTL code into a gate-level netlist using standard cells.  
2. **Floorplanning** – Defines the chip area, power distribution, and macro placement.  
3. **Placement** – Positions all standard cells within the defined floorplan.  
4. **Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)** – Distributes the clock signal evenly to all flip-flops.  
5. **Routing** – Connects all cells and nets based on the logical connections.  
6. **Static Timing Analysis (STA)** – Verifies timing constraints and ensures the design meets performance goals.

>  All these stages use the **same standard cells** characterized in the technology library.

## Placement in OpenLANE

The **placement** process in OpenLANE is divided into two main stages:


### 1. Global Placement

- Performs a **coarse placement** of standard cells.  
- Focuses on **reducing wire length** and optimizing connectivity.  
- No **legalization** (cell alignment or spacing check) happens at this stage.  
- OpenLANE uses **Half-Perimeter Wire Length (HPWL)** as the metric for placement optimization.

### 2. Detailed Placement

- Refines the placement from the global stage.  
- Ensures **standard cells are aligned** properly within defined **rows**.  
- Removes any **overlaps** between cells to create a legal and manufacturable layout.

## Standard Cell Design

A **standard cell** is a basic building block used in digital integrated circuit design.  
The **standard cell design flow** ensures that each cell is accurately modeled, verified, and ready for use in synthesis and physical design stages.

### Standard Cell Design Flow

The process consists of **three main elements**:


### Inputs

These are the essential resources required to start standard cell design:

- **PDKs (Process Design Kits)** – Provide technology-specific information.  
- **DRC & LVS Rules** – Define design and layout verification constraints.  
- **SPICE Models** – Represent electrical behavior of transistors and interconnects.  
- **Library & User-Defined Specifications** – Define performance, area, and power requirements.

### Design Steps

The core steps in creating a standard cell include:

- **Circuit Design** – Create the transistor-level schematic for the logic function.  
- **Layout Design** – Draw the physical geometry following DRC/LVS rules.  
- **Characterization** – Measure and model timing, power, and area for different operating conditions.


### Outputs

The results of the standard cell design flow include:

- **CDL (Circuit Description Language)** – Describes the transistor-level circuit.  
- **GDSII** – Contains the final physical layout ready for fabrication.  
- **LEF (Library Exchange Format)** – Abstract physical view used during floorplanning and placement.  
- **Extracted SPICE Netlist (.crc)** – Represents parasitic effects for accurate timing and power analysis.

## Standard Cell Characterization Flow

**Characterization** is the process of measuring and modeling the behavior of standard cells under different electrical conditions.  
It provides accurate data for **timing**, **power**, and **noise**, which are later used during synthesis and physical design.

### Standard Characterization Steps

1. **Read the Model Files**  
   - Load the transistor and device models (from PDK) required for SPICE simulations.

2. **Read the Extracted SPICE Netlist**  
   - Import the post-layout extracted netlist containing parasitic resistance and capacitance.

3. **Define or Recognize Circuit Behavior**  
   - Identify the logical function and pins (input, output, power) of the circuit.

4. **Read the Subcircuits**  
   - Include all dependent subcircuits (e.g., inverters, NAND, NOR) referenced in the main design.

5. **Attach Power Sources**  
   - Connect the power rails (**VDD** and **VSS**) to the circuit for simulation.

6. **Apply the Stimulus**  
   - Provide input signal transitions to test the behavior of the cell (e.g., rising/falling edges).

7. **Provide Output Capacitances**  
   - Connect capacitive loads to the outputs to emulate real interconnect and fan-out effects.

8. **Run Necessary Simulation Commands**  
   - Execute SPICE simulations to measure **delay**, **slew**, **power consumption**, and **noise** under various conditions.

</p>


After completing all the setup and simulation steps,  
**all the generated files** (model files, extracted SPICE netlist, subcircuits, stimulus, and simulation scripts)  
are provided as **inputs to the GUNA characterization software**.

GUNA uses these inputs to:
- Perform **timing**, **power**, and **noise** characterization.  
- Generate **.lib (timing library)** files used in synthesis and static timing analysis.

<img width="1756" height="668" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/312f5dd2-56f1-4549-b527-5609cdf8723c" />

## Timing Characterization 

| Parameter | Description | Typical Value |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Slew low rise threshold** | Voltage level where rising transition starts (low reference) | 20% of swing |
| **Slew high rise threshold** | Voltage level where rising transition ends (high reference) | 80% of swing |
| **Slew low fall threshold** | Voltage level where falling transition ends (low reference) | 20% of swing |
| **Slew high fall threshold** | Voltage level where falling transition starts (high reference) | 80% of swing |
| **Input rise threshold** | Input voltage reference for rise delay | 50% |
| **Input fall threshold** | Input voltage reference for fall delay | 50% |
| **Output rise threshold** | Output voltage reference for rise delay | 50% |
| **Output fall threshold** | Output voltage reference for fall delay | 50% |

> Percentages are relative to the **actual low and high voltages** of each transition.


### 1. Propagation Delay (`tpd`)

Time difference between when the **input** signal crosses its 50% level and when the **output** signal crosses its 50% level.

Propagation delay (rise):
t_pd,rise = t_out,50 - t_in,50

Propagation delay (fall):
t_pd,fall = t_out,50 - t_in,50

### 2. Transition Time / Slew

Duration for a signal to transition between two threshold points.

#### For Rising Edge:

Rise time:
t_rise = t_80 - t_20

Fall time:
t_fall = |t_80 - t_20|

These are also referred to as **input slew** or **output slew**, depending on which pin the waveform corresponds to.


# 3 - Design and characterize one library cell using Magic Layout tool and ngspice

## Modifying the Flow & Re-Running Floorplan

If any changes are made to the flow — for example, adjusting the **input and output port spacing** —  
you can update the configuration in the shell and **re-run the floorplan** command to observe the new I/O pin alignment.


```
set ::env(FP_IO_MODE) 2
run_floorplan
```

## SPICE Simulations (Pre-Layout)

SPICE simulations help verify the **functional** and **static behavior** of a circuit **before layout**.  
They are an essential step in validating circuit performance at the transistor level.

### SPICE Deck
- Defines the **circuit connectivity**, **component values**, and **node names**.  
- Acts as the input file for SPICE simulation.  
- Includes details such as voltage sources, resistors, capacitors, and transistors.

### NGSPICE 
- **NGSPICE** is an open-source circuit simulator used for **analog** and **mixed-signal** analysis.  
- It interprets the SPICE deck to perform simulations like DC, AC, and transient analysis.

### Static Behavior Evaluation
- Determines the **DC operating points**, **logic voltage levels**, and **steady-state conditions**.  
- Helps confirm the circuit’s correct operation before applying dynamic or transient signals.



## SPICE Simulation Lab for CMOS Inverter

This lab demonstrates how to perform a **SPICE simulation** for a CMOS inverter using the **Sky130 PDK** and **Magic** layout tool.

### Step 1: Clone the Standard Cell Repository

Use the following commands to clone the standard cell design repository and navigate into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nickson-jose/vsdstdcelldesign.git
cd vsdstdcelldesign
```

### Step 2: Prepare the Magic Technology File

Before opening the layout in Magic, you need the technology file `(sky130A.tech)`.

Navigate to the tech file location and copy it into your vsdstdcelldesign directory:
  
```
cp /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech \
/home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/vsdstdcelldesign
```

Step 3: Open the Layout in Magic

Use the following command to open the CMOS inverter layout (sky130_inv.mag) in Magic:

```
magic -T sky130A.tech sky130_inv.mag &
```

<img width="1920" height="923" alt="w6-inv" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8174055b-50cf-4317-9e69-cfda8fc82c18" />


16 mask CMOS fabrication process  
``` 
https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16-mask-process.pdf

```
- To view the layout:
  - Press **`s`** for *Select*
  - Press **`z`** for *Zoom*
- In **`tkcon`**, type the `what` command to view the **mask layers**.

<img width="1920" height="923" alt="w6-magic1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34fb64f7-90ba-463a-abf2-66bf51f05dd8" />

<img width="1920" height="923" alt="w6-magic2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f503983a-f685-4833-a99a-8bf572d1d3c1" />



- We need to **extract the parasitics** and **characterize the design**.  
- Open the **tkcon** window and execute the following commands:

```bash
  extract all
  ext2spice cthresh 0 rthresh 0
  ext2spice
```

<img width="1920" height="923" alt="w6d3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1720f68d-6ca4-458c-8eb5-93b5eb265735" />


### Modifying the SPICE File for Transient Response

To plot a **transient response**, we modify the SPICE file as follows:

1. **Change the scale value**  
   - Adjust the `.option scale` parameter according to the grid dimensions.  
   - Example:  
     ```spice
     .option scale=0.01u
     ```

2. **Include the NMOS and PMOS library files**  
   - Add the model library files for transistor definitions:  
     ```spice
     .include ./libs/pshort.lib
     .include ./libs/nshort.lib
     ```

3. **Define the supply voltage**  
   - Provide the power supply sources:  
     ```spice
     VDD VPWR 0 3.3V
     VSS VGND 0 0V
     ```

4. **Add the input signal**  
   - Define a pulse input for simulation:  
     ```spice
     Va A VGND PULSE(0V 3.3V 0 0.1ns 0.1ns 2ns 4ns)
     ```

5. **Include simulation commands**  
   - Add the transient analysis and control commands:  
     ```spice
     .tran 1n 20n
     .control
     run
     .endc
     .end
     ```
6. **Check and update model names**  
   - Open the included NMOS and PMOS library files (e.g., `pshort.lib`, `nshort.lib`)  
   - Verify the model names defined inside these files.  
   - Update the transistor definitions in your SPICE file to match them.  
     Example:  
     ```spice
     M0 Y A VGND VGND nshort_model.0 ...
     M1 Y A VPWR VPWR pshort_model.0 ...
     ```
     If the model names differ (e.g., `sky130_fd_pr__nfet_01v8` or `sky130_fd_pr__pfet_01v8`), change them accordingly.

plot the transient response with:
```
plot y vs time a
```

<img width="1920" height="920" alt="w6d34" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7ff7116-3c4c-45c6-bc80-4bf07725c945" />



- In the transient response **graph**, we can observe **spikes** due to a **small load capacitance (Cload)**.  
- To reduce these spikes, **increase the load capacitance** value.

Modify the capacitor line in the SPICE file as follows:

```spice
C3 Y VGND 2fF
```
then plot y vs time a again:

<img width="1920" height="920" alt="w6d35" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2122b1e-a27b-4766-b31e-b8e3be2150ac" />


> The output spikes are slightly reduced compared to the previous result, leading to a smoother transient response.

### Characterization of the Cell’s Slew Rate and Propagation Delay

#### Slew Rate

1. **Rise Transition**  
   - Time taken by the **output waveform** to transition from **20% (0.66 V)** to **80% (2.64 V)** of **VDD (3.3 V)**  
   - Calculation:  
     ```
     2.19945 ns - 2.15722 ns = 0.03728 ns
     ```
   - **Rise Slew Rate = 0.03728 ns**

2. **Fall Transition**  
   - Time taken by the **output waveform** to transition from **80% (2.64 V)** to **20% (0.66 V)** of **VDD**  
   - Calculation:  
     ```
     4.06716 ns - 4.03940 ns = 0.02776 ns
     ```
   - **Fall Slew Rate = 0.02776 ns**

#### Propagation Delay

3. **Rise Cell Delay**  
   - The difference between the time when both **input and output** are at **50% (1.65 V)** — i.e., output rising while input is falling  
   - Calculation:  
     ```
     2.18132 ns - 2.14945 ns = 0.03187 ns
     ```
   - **Rise Propagation Delay = 0.03187 ns**

4. **Fall Cell Delay**  
   - The difference between the time when both **input and output** are at **50% (1.65 V)** — i.e., output falling while input is rising  
   - Calculation:  
     ```
     4.059292 ns - 4.04958 ns = 0.009712 ns
     ```
   - **Fall Propagation Delay = 0.009712 ns**

# 4 - Pre-layout timing analysis and importance of good clock tree

## LAB

* OpenLANE is a tool for place and route, which places cells in a design. When using this tool, the full information contained in the .mag file, which includes boundry,power and ground, logic, etc., is not necessary. Instead, only the essential information, such as the placement boundary, power and ground rails, and input and output ports, is required. This information is contained in lef files, which protect the IP(intellectual property). 
* The goal is to extract the lef file from the .mag file and use it to replace the standard cells in the design. There are guidelines to follow when creating a standard cell set for use in place and route
   * I/p and O/p port must lies on the intersection of the vertical and horizontal tracks
   * Width oof the std cell should be in the odd ultiples of the track pitch
   * Height should be odd multiples of vertical track pitch
   
  * To run the previous flow follow this command
 ```
   prep -design picorv32a -tag
 
 ```
 * In these directory `/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/openlane/sky130_fd_sc_hd/` we can find tracks
 ```
 ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/vsdstdcelldesign$ cd ../../pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/openlane/sky130_fd_sc_hd/
 
 ```
 * tpye command ` less tracks.info`
 ```
 less tracks.info
 
 ```
 <img width="956" alt="4 1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64173714/215493780-f81c412d-a0eb-49a8-b4a7-ce6e5fd2cd34.png">
 
 * open the layout from vsdstdcelldesign directory
 
 ``` 
    magic -T sky130.tech sky130_inv.mag
 
 ```
In the tkon terminal, use the grid command to compare the tracks' information

<img width="960" alt="4 2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64173714/215494843-c069b012-c948-4dd9-9164-d43678a4d5cc.png">

The three guidelines are clearly shown in the illustration in this image

<img width="958" alt="4 3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64173714/215496521-f3f79ae8-e302-4155-8946-244049d897dd.png">

* The information from the .mag file will be extracted into a LEF file, which will contain essential details for placement and routing, such as cell dimensions, port information, and specific properties. The first step in creating the LEF file is to clearly define the port definitions, including the class and intended use of each port
* Save the mag file and relaunch the magic tool. Then run the command below to create the lef file
```
    lef write
```
<img width="1258" height="638" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-12 105006" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab291006-0aea-4cb1-8536-591ed9bb6437" />

#### 4. Copy the newly generated lef and associated required lib files to 'picorv32a' design 'src' directory.

Commands to copy necessary files to 'picorv32a' design 'src' directory

```bash
# Copy lef file
cp sky130_vsdinv.lef ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/src/

# List and check whether it's copied
ls ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/src/

# Copy lib files
cp libs/sky130_fd_sc_hd__* ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/src/

# List and check whether it's copied
ls ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/src/
```

Screenshot of commands run

<img width="1920" height="920" alt="w6d41" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aec75594-9954-46ee-8e2d-aa69c741e6f9" />


#### 5. Edit 'config.tcl' to change lib file and add the new extra lef into the openlane flow.

Commands to be added to config.tcl to include our custom cell in the openlane flow

```tcl
set ::env(LIB_SYNTH) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__typical.lib"
set ::env(LIB_FASTEST) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__fast.lib"
set ::env(LIB_SLOWEST) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__slow.lib"
set ::env(LIB_TYPICAL) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__typical.lib"

set ::env(EXTRA_LEFS) [glob $::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/$::env(DESIGN_NAME)/src/*.lef]
```

Edited config.tcl to include the added lef and change library to ones we added in src directory


#### 6. Run openlane flow synthesis with newly inserted custom inverter cell.

Commands to invoke the OpenLANE flow include new lef and perform synthesis 
First do it normally without changing anythng you will get:
<img width="1920" height="923" alt="w6d49" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68924c7f-929c-4f44-ae4a-acb14e13292c" />

Here the wns is very high

Now do these changes:
```bash


Commands to view and change parameters to improve timing and run synthesis

```tcl
# Now once again we have to prep design so as to update variables
prep -design picorv32a -tag 31-10_13-15 -overwrite

# Addiitional commands to include newly added lef to openlane flow merged.lef
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

# Command to display current value of variable SYNTH_STRATEGY
echo $::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY)

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_STRATEGY
set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) "DELAY 3"

# Command to display current value of variable SYNTH_BUFFERING to check whether it's enabled
echo $::env(SYNTH_BUFFERING)

# Command to display current value of variable SYNTH_SIZING
echo $::env(SYNTH_SIZING)

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_SIZING
set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1

# Command to display current value of variable SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL to check whether it's the proper cell or not
echo $::env(SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL)

# Now that the design is prepped and ready, we can run synthesis using following command
run_synthesis
```

Screenshots of commands run
<img width="1920" height="923" alt="w6d48" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4f8089a-3317-4ce5-af7e-934e1a16e6c3" />

Comparing to previously noted run values area has increased and worst negative slack has become 0

![Screenshot from 2024-03-24 17-11-08](https://github.com/fayizferosh/soc-design-and-planning-nasscom-vsd/assets/63997454/81418082-747e-4702-b5ad-bb3e450eceb3)

#### 8. Once synthesis has accepted our custom inverter we can now run floorplan and placement and verify the cell is accepted in PnR flow.

Now that our custom inverter is properly accepted in synthesis we can now run floorplan using following command

```tcl
# Now we can run floorplan
run_floorplan
```


If you are facing unexpected un-explainable error while using `run_floorplan` command, we can instead use the following set of commands available based on information from `Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/scripts/tcl_commands/floorplan.tcl` and also based on `Floorplan Commands` section in `Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/docs/source/OpenLANE_commands.md`

```tcl
# Follwing commands are alltogather sourced in "run_floorplan" command
init_floorplan
place_io
tap_decap_or
```
This will do the thing

Now that floorplan is done we can do placement using following command

```tcl
# Now we are ready to run placement
run_placement
```


Commands to load placement def in magic in another terminal

```bash
# Change directory to path containing generated placement def
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/31-10_13-15/results/placement/

# Command to load the placement def in magic tool
magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.placement.def &
```

Command for tkcon window to view internal layers of cells

```tcl
# Command to view internal connectivity layers
expand
```

Abutment of power pins with other cell from library clearly visible

<img width="1920" height="923" alt="w6d412" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/970f7bf1-ff12-48b5-b078-68b8d7b08c18" />


#### 9. Do Post-Synthesis timing analysis with OpenSTA tool.

Since we are having 0 wns after improved timing run we are going to do timing analysis on initial run of synthesis which has lots of violations and no parameters were added to improve timing

Commands to invoke the OpenLANE flow include new lef and perform synthesis 

```bash
# Change directory to openlane flow directory
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

# alias docker='docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) efabless/openlane:v0.21'
# Since we have aliased the long command to 'docker' we can invoke the OpenLANE flow docker sub-system by just running this command
docker
```
```tcl
# Now that we have entered the OpenLANE flow contained docker sub-system we can invoke the OpenLANE flow in the Interactive mode using the following command
./flow.tcl -interactive

# Now that OpenLANE flow is open we have to input the required packages for proper functionality of the OpenLANE flow
package require openlane 0.9

# Now the OpenLANE flow is ready to run any design and initially we have to prep the design creating some necessary files and directories for running a specific design which in our case is 'picorv32a'
prep -design picorv32a

# Adiitional commands to include newly added lef to openlane flow
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_SIZING
set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1

# Now that the design is prepped and ready, we can run synthesis using following command
run_synthesis
```

again you get wns as -23.89.

Since more fanout is causing more delay we can add parameter to reduce fanout and do synthesis again

Commands to include new lef and perform synthesis 

```tcl
# Now the OpenLANE flow is ready to run any design and initially we have to prep the design creating some necessary files and directories for running a specific design which in our case is 'picorv32a'
prep -design picorv32a -tag 25-03_18-52 -overwrite

# Adiitional commands to include newly added lef to openlane flow
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_SIZING
set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT
set ::env(SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT) 4

# Command to display current value of variable SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL to check whether it's the proper cell or not

#### 10. Make timing ECO fixes to remove all violations.

OR gate of drive strength 2 is driving 4 fanouts

![Screenshot from 2024-03-26 06-55-46](https://github.com/fayizferosh/soc-design-and-planning-nasscom-vsd/assets/63997454/73c58332-a212-4a24-b853-e8cae3b385a6)

Commands to perform analysis and optimize timing by replacing with OR gate of drive strength 4

```tcl
# Reports all the connections to a net
report_net -connections _11672_

# Checking command syntax
help replace_cell

# Replacing cell
replace_cell _14510_ sky130_fd_sc_hd__or3_4

# Generating custom timing report
report_checks -fields {net cap slew input_pins} -digits 4
```

*We started ECO fixes at wns -23.9000 and now we stand at wns -22.6173 we reduced around 1.2827 ns of violation*

#### 11. Replace the old netlist with the new netlist generated after timing ECO fix and implement the floorplan, placement and cts.

Now to insert this updated netlist to PnR flow and we can use `write_verilog` and overwrite the synthesis netlist but before that we are going to make a copy of the old old netlist

Commands to make copy of netlist

```bash
# Change from home directory to synthesis results directory
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/25-03_18-52/results/synthesis/

# List contents of the directory
ls

# Copy and rename the netlist
cp picorv32a.synthesis.v picorv32a.synthesis_old.v

# List contents of the directory
ls
```

Commands to write verilog

```tcl
# Check syntax
help write_verilog

# Overwriting current synthesis netlist
write_verilog /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/25-03_18-52/results/synthesis/picorv32a.synthesis.v

Verified that the netlist is overwritten by checking that instance `_14506_`  is replaced with `sky130_fd_sc_hd__or4_4`

![Screenshot from 2024-03-26 11-01-25](https://github.com/fayizferosh/soc-design-and-planning-nasscom-vsd/assets/63997454/1ddb66da-64cb-426d-8d78-30370c63dacb)

Since we confirmed that netlist is replaced and will be loaded in PnR but since we want to follow up on the earlier 0 violation design we are continuing with the clean design to further stages

Commands load the design and run necessary stages

```tcl
# Now once again we have to prep design so as to update variables
prep -design picorv32a -tag 24-03_10-03 -overwrite

# Addiitional commands to include newly added lef to openlane flow merged.lef
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_STRATEGY
set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) "DELAY 3"

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_SIZING
set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1

# Now that the design is prepped and ready, we can run synthesis using following command
run_synthesis

# Follwing commands are alltogather sourced in "run_floorplan" command
init_floorplan
place_io
tap_decap_or

# Now we are ready to run placement
run_placement

# Incase getting error
unset ::env(LIB_CTS)

# With placement done we are now ready to run CTS
run_cts
```

## Section 5 - Final steps for RTL2GDS using tritonRoute and openSTA (25/03/2024 - 26/03/2024)

### Theory

### Implementation

* Section 5 tasks:-
1. Perform generation of Power Distribution Network (PDN) and explore the PDN layout.
2. Perfrom detailed routing using TritonRoute.
3. Post-Route parasitic extraction using SPEF extractor.
4. Post-Route OpenSTA timing analysis with the extracted parasitics of the route.

* All section 5 logs, reports and results can be found in following run folder:

[Section 5 Run - 26-03_08-45](https://github.com/fayizferosh/soc-design-and-planning-nasscom-vsd/tree/main/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/26-03_08-45)

#### 1. Perform generation of Power Distribution Network (PDN) and explore the PDN layout.

Commands to perform all necessary stages up until now

```bash
# Change directory to openlane flow directory
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

# alias docker='docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) efabless/openlane:v0.21'
# Since we have aliased the long command to 'docker' we can invoke the OpenLANE flow docker sub-system by just running this command
docker
```
```tcl
# Now that we have entered the OpenLANE flow contained docker sub-system we can invoke the OpenLANE flow in the Interactive mode using the following command
./flow.tcl -interactive

# Now that OpenLANE flow is open we have to input the required packages for proper functionality of the OpenLANE flow
package require openlane 0.9

# Now the OpenLANE flow is ready to run any design and initially we have to prep the design creating some necessary files and directories for running a specific design which in our case is 'picorv32a'
prep -design picorv32a

# Addiitional commands to include newly added lef to openlane flow merged.lef
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_STRATEGY
set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) "DELAY 3"

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_SIZING
set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1

# Now that the design is prepped and ready, we can run synthesis using following command
run_synthesis

# Following commands are alltogather sourced in "run_floorplan" command
init_floorplan
place_io
tap_decap_or

# Now we are ready to run placement
run_placement

# Incase getting error
unset ::env(LIB_CTS)

# With placement done we are now ready to run CTS
run_cts

# Now that CTS is done we can do power distribution network
gen_pdn 
```
